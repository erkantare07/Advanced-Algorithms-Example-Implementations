# Monochromatic Squares

# DEFINITION: A square Q with side length n â‚¬ N is subdivided into n^2 squares of side length 1 that are all parallel to Q. 
# Each one of the small squares is either colored grey or white.

# GOAL: The goal is to determine the side length and the position of the biggest square in Q that is completely colored in 
# white and parallel to Q. 
# NOTE: In case there is more than one such square, any one of those may be chosen.

# ASSUME: Upper left corner of the square is at (0, 0) and the lower right corner is at (n, n). 
# Going down increases the x-coordinate and going right increases the y-coordinate.
# S.t. it will have the same structure as the list representation of a 2D array => Easier debugging.
